Good choice. This is the **right level of thinking**.

Below is a **ruthless, age-appropriate 2–3 year execution plan** designed to turn you into a **real Cloud Architect candidate**, not a cert collector. Read it carefully—this is a blueprint.

---

# CLOUD ARCHITECT ROADMAP (AGE 15 → 18/19)

This plan assumes:

* You are disciplined
* You study consistently (1–2 hrs/day on weekdays, more on weekends)
* You care about **understanding**, not rushing

---

## YEAR 1 (AGE 15–16): FOUNDATIONS + CLOUD ENTRY

### Phase 1: Core Foundations (3–4 months)

**Goal:** Not struggle later.

#### Networking

* IP addressing, subnetting (basic)
* DNS, HTTP/HTTPS
* Firewalls, ports

You don’t need CCNA-level depth. You need **clarity**.

#### Linux

* File system
* Permissions
* Basic commands
* Services & processes

If Linux scares you, DevOps and cloud are dead ends.

---

### Phase 2: Programming & Web Literacy (3 months)

**Goal:** Understand how apps talk to infrastructure.

* Git & GitHub (daily use)
* Web basics (HTTP, APIs, JSON)
* Python (scripts, APIs, automation)
* Flask: **only basic CRUD**, nothing fancy
* SQL: tables, relationships, indexes

⚠️ Stop before you fall into “backend developer” mode.

---

### Phase 3: Cloud Fundamentals (1–1.5 months)

**Goal:** Think in cloud terms.

* **AZ-900**
* Microsoft Learn + exam-style questions
* Pass the exam only when ready

This is your **first serious credential**.

---

## YEAR 2 (AGE 16–17): REAL CLOUD SKILL

### Phase 4: Azure Administrator (4–5 months)

**Goal:** Become operationally competent.

* **AZ-104**
* Azure Portal + CLI
* VMs, VNets, NSGs
* Identity (Entra ID, RBAC)
* Monitoring, backups, cost control

This phase separates serious learners from tourists.

By the end:

> You should be able to explain why an architecture is good or bad.

---

### Phase 5: DevOps Basics (3 months)

**Goal:** Automate what you understand.

* GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps
* CI/CD concepts
* Docker (containers, images)
* Intro to IaC (Bicep or Terraform)

No YAML memorization without meaning.

---

## YEAR 3 (AGE 17–18/19): ARCHITECTURE & MATURITY

### Phase 6: Architecture Thinking (3–4 months)

**Goal:** Stop thinking like an operator.

* **AZ-305**
* Design for:

  * High availability
  * Disaster recovery
  * Cost optimization
  * Security

This is where **decision-making** matters.

---

### Phase 7: Specialization & Portfolio (Ongoing)

Choose ONE:

* DevOps deepening
* Cloud security
* Cloud + AI foundations

Build:

* Architecture diagrams
* Small case studies
* “Why I chose this design” explanations

That’s what impresses real engineers.

---

## What This Plan AVOIDS (On Purpose)

* Random tutorials
* Too many frameworks
* Cert hoarding
* Shallow DevOps

Most people fail because they rush. You won’t.

---

## Reality Check (Mentor Mode)

If you follow this plan:

* By 18–19, you’ll be **dangerously competent**
* You’ll outperform many degree holders
* You’ll understand systems, not just tools

If you don’t:

* You’ll stay stuck watching videos forever

---

### Next Step

Say **one** of the following:

* **“Break Year 1 into weekly tasks”**
* **“Start Phase 1: Networking lesson 1”**

Choose.
