Understood. Here is the full Cloud-Architect Track Skill Checklist — clean, structured, and ruthless.
You can copy this into Notion/Google Keep and tick items as you finish.

___
The learning loop (this is law)

For every topic:

Learn (docs or short video)

Implement (from scratch)

Break it

Fix it

Explain it aloud

If step 5 fails, repeat.

If you complete everything in this checklist, you WILL become a Cloud Engineer → Cloud Architect.

If you want, I can turn this into:

1. A 1-year execution plan


2. A weekly study routine


3. A Notion template


4. A PDF version



Which one?
